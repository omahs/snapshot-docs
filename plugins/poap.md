# POAP

POAP are badges which are non-fungible tokens (NFT). Each time you participate in an event, POAP collectors get a unique badge that is supported by a cryptographic record. **** With the POAP plugin, you can reward voters in your space with a unique POAP for each of your Proposals on Snapshot.
