# Create a space

{% hint style="info" %}
If you already have a space without ENS domain (legacy), you need to [Migrate your space to ENS](https://docs.snapshot.page/spaces/migrate).
{% endhint %}

### 1. Set or get an ENS domain for your space

Tap the plus (+) button in the left sidebar to start creating your space.

If you already own an ENS domain, make sure you are connected to [snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org/#/setup) with the Ethereum address that is set as controller of your ENS name. Your ENS name will appear and you will be started by tapping on it.\
\
If you need to register an ENS domain, enter a name that suit the needs of your DAO in the `register a new domain` field and tap register, you can then follow [before-creating-your-space.md](before-creating-your-space.md "mention") and come back here for step 2 once registered.\
\


### 2. Set space controller (ENS text-record)

By default the address of the currently logged account is pre-filled, you can customize it by tapping on the switcher then entering the wallet address that you would like to set as the space controller and click "Set controller". &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need to sign a transaction on the Ethereum Mainnet to set the ENS text-record.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 3. Create your profile

To complete your profile, you can upload an avatar/logo, enter a name for your DAO (mandatory), a description, select a category and some other details. These settings can be changed later in your space settings.

At this stage, you have to choose one the three following ways to implement the strategy that will define how the voting power of your voters is fetched.

### Let's see those three options in detail&#x20;

#### Token weighted voting

Votes are weighted by a token. The token can be an ERC-20, ERC-721 or ERC-1155 token standard

1. Select your token network
2. Select your token standard
3. Enter your token contract address

#### One person, one vote

This option can be used in two different ways:

* Whitelist voting let you specify a list of addresses that will be able to vote
* Ticket voting will let any wallet vote (mostly for testing purpose)

#### Custom setup

If you feel ready to deep dive in the custom setup here are a few hints that you may find useful:\
\
\- You can select up to 8 strategies, voting power is cumulative.\
\- Network can be selected independently for each strategy to achieve multi-chain.\
\- You can set a different symbol for each strategy, it will be displayed on the details of a vote.\
\
At the time of writing this article Snapshot count around 350 strategies and this number keep increasing. [Learn more about the strategies. ](../strategies/what-is-a-strategy.md)
