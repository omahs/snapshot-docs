# Badges and warnings

At Snapshot Labs, we want to help our users safely browse and discover spaces and make informed decisions about them. That’s why we’ve introduced verified labels and warning flags.

The goal is to provide users a simple way to navigate voting in web3. We apply a checkmark or warning label next to space name in most popular spaces and in each of their proposal.

The checkmark badge signifies that the space has been verified as the authentic version of the protocol it claims to be. Please note that the verified badge does not represent an endorsement of the protocol by Snapshot Labs. A verified badge also says nothing about its merits as an investment. A space may carry a verified badge but might still be a bad investment idea. Think of the verified badge only as a tool to help you find the correct version of the space you’re searching for.\

The red exclamation mark flag mean that we either identified that space as impersonating a project, IP infringement or potential scam.
