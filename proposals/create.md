# Create a proposal

### What is a proposal?&#x20;

A proposal has a content that describes the issue of a vote. It also has a voting system that determines how voters can select choices and how its results will be calculated.&#x20;

### How to create a proposal

* Go to a project space and tap on the "Connect wallet" button in the top right corner.
* Connect with the wallet provider where you hold relevant tokens and tap on “New proposal.”
* Fill out the Title, Description (optional,) and Discussion (optional) link of your proposal.
* Tap on the “Continue” button and select the desired [voting system](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types) and add your voting options.
* Enter the start date and end date of your proposal to determine the proposal voting period. Make sure you allow enough time for voting.
* Tap on “Publish” and your proposal is created!&#x20;

### **Snapshot block number**

When you create a proposal, by default the "snapshot block number" will be populated with the latest block sync from our node.

Depending on the settings of the space, either everyone holding a sufficient amount of tokens can vote or only members holding a sufficient amount of tokens can submit a proposal.

### Proposals limitations

* There is a character limit of 6400 for the description of a proposal.
* Strategies are limited to 8. You should also respect this limitation when you use the multichain strategy.
